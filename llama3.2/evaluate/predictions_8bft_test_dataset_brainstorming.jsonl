Apart from a vibrant, musical feel and decent sized downtown area, there are some great places to visit, hangout and eat at. The Domain is a chic urban living area just north of downtown. Lake travis and the shoreline offer ample parks and hiking choices, and a must visit eat/drink location, The Oasis. West of Austin offers a peak at hill country, and Balcon Canyonlands, an open area for ample hiking opportunities. Mount Bonnell, a great short hike, and a beautiful view of sunset over colorado river. Barton Creek and Bee Cave also has a lot of activities going on. In the middle of downtown one can walk or bike on the boardwalk over ladybird lake, or just go chill at Zilker park."
