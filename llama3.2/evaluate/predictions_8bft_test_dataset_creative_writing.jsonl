He lived in a small little twig house, on the side of a great big pond. He loved his little house. He especially loved how close he was to the water, which let him go out swimming, searching for yummy bugs to eat.\n\nOne night he was feeling lonely. It was just him in that tiny little house, by the great big pond. He looked up at the moon and wondered who else lived up there. He said, \"If only I could climb up to the moon, I would find friends and be happy\". Mr. Wilson noticed a grand and towering tree across the river. He thought to himself, \"If I can climb that tree, then I can make it up to the moon!\" \n\nSo he ventured out on a journey to make it up the tree. He rushed through the tall grass, moving quickly so the cats and dogs would not see him. When he made it to the tree he met an old squirrel friend named Ron. Ron was happy to help Mr. Wilson up the tree. So Mr. Wilson jumped on Ron's back and had a bouncy ride to the top. \n\nMr. Wilson made it to the top, but the tree needed to be taller! He still was so far away from the moon. Mr. Wilson put his head down and started to cry. He said, \"Ron, I can't get to the moon... I'll always be lonely!\".

He especially loved how close he was to the water, which let him go out swimming, searching for yummy bugs to eat.\n\nOne night he was feeling lonely. It was just him in that tiny little house, by the great big pond. He looked up at the moon and wondered who else lived up there. He said, \"If only I could climb up to the moon, I would find friends and be happy\". Mr. Wilson noticed a grand and towering tree across the river. He thought to himself, \"If I can climb that tree, then I can make it up to the moon!\" \n\nSo he ventured out on a journey to make it up the tree. He rushed through the tall grass, moving quickly so the cats and dogs would not see him. When he made it to the tree he met an old squirrel friend named Ron. Ron was happy to help Mr. Wilson up the tree. So Mr. Wilson jumped on Ron's back and had a bouncy ride to the top. \n\nMr. Wilson made it to the top, but the tree needed to be taller! He still was so far away from the moon. Mr. Wilson put his head down and started to cry. He said, \"Ron, I can't get to the moon... I'll always be lonely!\". Ron responded, \"Look around Mr. Wilson, can't you see all the friends in the forest. You don't need to go to the moon! There is plenty of fun you can have right here!\".

        "text": "<|user|> Instruction: Should the US government pay reparations?\nContext: \n<|assistant|> Due to potential issues regarding responsibility, distribution, and cost, the U.S. Government should not award monetary reparations to the descendants of slaves. Wether or not the current government is ultimately responsible for the treatment of slaves, providing reparations, or monetary repayment for the government\u2019s transgressions towards slaves, for the descendants of slaves may not be the most practical of beneficial solution. Instead, the government should focus on funding schooling, medicare, and communities of disadvantaged people of color.\nA major flaw in the distribution of monetary reparations is determining which individuals or communities are descendants of slaves. Because slavery ended over 150 years ago, \u201cmost institutions don\u2019t have good enough records to trace the actual descendants of slaves\u201d (Jones). The potential inaccuracy in identifying descendants could lead to overspending on reparations, potential accusations of fraud, and countless other complaints.\n\tResponsibility also plays a large role in determining if or how to distribute monetary reparations. While plantation owners are notoriously considered slave owners, \u201cthe Catholic Church was among the largest institutional slaveholders in the Americas\u201d (Jones). Other large corporations which took advantage of the American slave system include both insurance and railroad companies: \u201cInsurance companies sold policies on the lives of enslaved people (for their owners\u2019 profit, of course) or underwrote slaving voyages. Railroads used slave labor and profited from transporting cotton or rice produced by enslaved plantation workers\u201d (Jones). Given that both religious and industrial groups also had a rather large influence on the American slave system, the responsibility of the government to repay the descendants of slaves seems unreasonable. \nTo be able to pay the descendants of slaves, the government would also have to spend an excessive amount of money. Payment for slave labor requires adding up 24 hours, 365 days, for 246 years, plus inflation, the overall amount estimated to be upwards of $10 trillion. Even in smaller amounts \u201cseeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to \u2018about 2% of federal expenditures now\u2019\u201d (Huddleston). Is that amount worth it? During his testimony, Beckett argued that money reparations are meaningless. Throwing money at a problem won\u2019t solve it: it won\u2019t end racism and it will cause the economy to plummet deeper in debt, creating more issues than it solves (Beckett). Not only would these reparations be a waste of taxpayer money, but it is understood that \u201cthe majority of Americans were not slave owners and even in the South, only one in five owned slaves,\u201d more convincingly, \u201cmany Americans today have no connection to slavery at all since they immigrated here after 1865\u201d (Source G). \nArguments could be made for the imbalance of reparations, as minorities such as Native American tribes have been given land and monetary reparations by the U.S. government. While these minorities have received reparations, these reparations directly to the victims. A table of previous reparations payments made to minorities/racially targeted groups that span from 1952-1990. The most recent and largest payment was in 1990, from the US government to Japanese American citizens, of $1.2 billion (about $20,000 each) in response to the Japanese encampments during World War II (Source D). While these payments were made to these minority groups, all these reparations were ordered while the original victims of the injustices were still alive, not over 150 years after the fact.\nThe complete dismissal of reparations, however, should not be administered. Focusing our attention on better ways to repay the descendants of slaves would be generally beneficial to the country, as Nathalie argued that descendants have no wealth. Given that a major source of wealth is inheritance, the lack of black property ownership means a less distinctive inheritance among black families for future generations (Nathalie). While reparations can be spent in the communities of descendants and underfunded black families, this affects people who may not be descendants, not specific to victims: \u201cRecipients of reparations should be \u2018the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families\u2019\u201d (Source G). Despite this, former President Barack Obama stated that \u201cthe best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,\u201d and that those reparations could potentially \u201ctake the form of government programs to help struggling people of all races\u201d (Source E). During her testimony, Michelle agreed, claiming that using reparations as a way of creating better schools and jobs for people who are struggling is a more beneficial way to use these monetary reparations (Michelle). Overall, the U.S. government, rather than distributing payments to individuals or communities, should focus on funding underprivileged or discriminated communities of traditionally black descendants, as this approach would create more opportunities and equality for discriminated black communities.",

        "context": "",
        "text": "<|user|> Instruction: What is the concept of a good life according to Socrates and Aristotle, and what are the components that contribute to it? Is a good life innate or learned, and can anyone achieve it?\nContext: \n<|assistant|> One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a \u201cgood\u201d one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato\u2019s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one\u2019s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author\u2019s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one\u2019s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest \u201cgood\u201d, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner \u2014 that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn\u2019t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one\u2019s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, \u201cSimilarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, \u201cwealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one\u2019s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it\u2019s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, \u201cWealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.\u201d (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates\u2019 beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth\u2019s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which \u201cgoodness\u201d lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one\u2019s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one\u2019s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, \u201ca good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.\u201d (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, \u201cThe highest good, on the other hand, must be something final\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1 pg. 14) Stating that while there are different branches of a good life, virtuous behavior is not a constant and therefore you cannot give a description to their life as a whole until it\u2019s end. Socrates\u2019 arguments on the length of goodness are rather naive, seeing as people change over time, only with the entire information of their lives can one make a claim as to whether or not they had a good life.\nIn summary, the two different views on how we are to live a good life together provide insight and theory into the subject but neither provides a complete instruction on doing so. Socrates, as written down by Plato, describes his own life which he\nDahlke 5\n\nconsiders to be a virtuous one and Aristotle provides a philosophical theory behind how to live in a virtuous way with the end goal of happiness or in other words a good life. The closest we can get to understanding how to live a good life is by understanding what makes up a good life, and even this is subjective. One person\u2019s views on what a virtuous life means can differ greatly from the next depending on where they lived, their religious beliefs, or social status. These variances result in many different guides to and definitions of a good life. Within all the different viewpoints, a concept introduced in Nicomachean Ethics that can be widely accepted is that within someone\u2019s life there is a median point between each of their emotions, actions and characteristics that create virtue and lead towards a good life.",
        "predicted_response": "\n\nSocrates' and Aristotle's concepts of the good life were explored through their works on ethics, the concept of virtues and their place within the good life. Socrates believed the concept of the good life was to be discovered through understanding the good and then using that understanding to navigate life and its choices. Socrates also believed the good life could not be achieved through reason and was instead learned by being led by reason and guided by divine guidance.\n\nAristotle's view of the good life, on the other hand, held that the concept was something that could be learned through education. Aristotle believed in a view that humans have a natural inclination to",
        "response": "One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a \u201cgood\u201d one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato\u2019s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one\u2019s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author\u2019s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one\u2019s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest \u201cgood\u201d, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner \u2014 that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn\u2019t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one\u2019s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, \u201cSimilarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, \u201cwealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one\u2019s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it\u2019s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, \u201cWealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.\u201d (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates\u2019 beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth\u2019s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which \u201cgoodness\u201d lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one\u2019s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one\u2019s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, \u201ca good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.\u201d (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, \u201cThe highest good, on the other hand, must be something final\u201d (Aristotle.

        "response": "While it is obvious that nutrition should impact health, the modern medical paradigm has refused to account for, or at least minimised, its role in human health. Food is critical to human survival, and nutritious food is a prerequisite for creating and maintaining a healthy human body and mind. Consuming the wrong kinds of foods can wreak havoc on human metabolism, and over time, lead to hormonal disorders, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The world is witness to increased cases of such disorders since the time of the industrialisation of the food and pharmaceutical industries. After World War 2, since the 1970s, the rates of incidence of the aforementioned diseases have increased manifold, correlated strongly with the increased consumption of processed foods, seed oils, sugar and carbohydrates while being negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fats and red meat. Thus, while the average life expectancy of human beings has increased, albeit differently for different regions of the world, with the increasing contribution of modern medical practice, the quality of life for most people has decreased. The case can be made that we, as a society, are becoming calorie-rich but nutrient-poor, with negative outcomes for public health."

        "text": "<|user|> Instruction: Give me a proof that the square root of 2 is irrational\nContext: \n<|assistant|> Here is a proof by contradiction that the square root of 2 is irrational. First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove.",

The square root of 2 must therefore be in the form a/b for some a and b.\n\nIf it is rational, then we know that a^2 must be divisible by b for it to be rational. But it must be the case that a^2 = b^2*2 since the square root of 2 squared is equal to 2 itself. Now we have a^2/b^2 = 2.\n\nHowever, if this equation is simplified it is equivalent to saying that 2*b^2/a^2 = 2 or b^2 =",

Our meals tasted the best after a lenghty daily travel, and the most enjoyable was the deep conversations we had without interruption of phone or social media. I shared my never spoken before youth experiences growing up in Iran. He seemed delighted to be hearing my experience and taking a mental note every step of the way.\nUpon reflecting on our trip, we encountered numerous challenges. We lost our way for several miles, and to compound our predicament, our bikes broke down along the way. In addition, we were cited by the police for riding our bikes on the freeway and physically assaulted. Despite all these setbacks, we pushed ourselves to ride up to 80 miles each day.\nEven to this day, my son frequently recalls our trip and how it brought us closer together. He also acknowledges the spiritual growth that we experienced as a result of the journey.\nHe was accpeted as the only two students to Berkely and many months later I asked him what set him apart from all A's students which he then responded my colledge essay and our SF biking trip."

Portland is known for Voodoo donuts, a popular and unique donut store. \n\nOverall, both are great options and it boils down to what things you enjoy doing most."

Look for the edges that match the center color and put them in their respective places on the first layer. This layer will be completed when you have all four matching edge pieces in place.\n\nBuild the second layer: Once the first layer is complete, turn the cube over and find the middle row. Look for the edge pieces that belong on this layer, and move them into place with an algorithm. The goal is to build a complete layer with the same color as the center.\n\nBuild the final layer: The final layer can be tricky, but with practice, it becomes easier. First, align the corners of the final layer with the corresponding edges. Then, apply an algorithm to move the corners to their correct positions.

Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for me to use the bottle, or to take it on a trip for fear of further leaks.\n\nIs there any chance you could refund the price of the bottle, or alternatively send me a new one?\n\nKind regards"

        "text": "<|user|> Instruction: What should I look for when looking for a used car?\nContext: \n<|assistant|> Items to look for when looking to purchase a used car:\n\n* First of all, ask about any major work done to the car like engine, suspension, body work. If it's been in any accidents that may have impacted it's chassis at all. Later on when we're examining the car we may find evidence of damage or repair work, and it's good to know if the seller is lying to cover up any issues before we start negotiating price with them. Pulling the carfax can also be a good way to check if the seller is lying since it often contains detailed information about repair that has been performed to the car. If you notice that the seller is lying either after pulling the carfax or after inspecting the body, it's best not to purchase the car.\n\n* Ask the owner if they have any maintenance records. If they do, that not only means that the car has received the proper care but it also illustrates that the buyer is the kind of person that is very organized and likes to keep their processions in good condition, which is super important. That's the kind of person you want to be buying a car from. Also note that if the owner has been taking the car to the dealership or to an independent shop it's very easy to obtain these service records using the VIN number either online or by calling the mechanic directly.\n\n* Cars having a timing belt needs to be replaced every 70,000-100,000 miles. You can easily check if the car you're planning on purchasing has a timing belt or timing chain. Typically timing chains do not need to be replaced for the life of the car, so finding a car with a timing chain means that you have to worry less about this aspect. Depending on the car replacing the timing belt can be from 1,000 to 6,000 dollars so it's a pretty significant expense that you should take into account.\n\n* Ask how frequently the owner has been changing the oil. In most cases changing it every 3,000 to 6,000 or every year (whichever comes first) is ideal. Many owner manuals mention that you can go over this mileage. In some cases manuals mention oil change intervals of 10,000 or 20,000 miles. Personally, I would not consider a car that has its oil replaced this infrequently. In many cases, these longer intervals are an attempt by the manufacturer's marketing department  to make the car more appealing to buyers if it requires less maintenance. Also ask if they've been using synthetic oil. Typically synthetic oil doesn't break down over time so longer intervals might be ok.\n\n* Ask when was the last time brake pads and rotors have been replaced. Typically brake pads need to be replaced every 50000-100000 miles. Brake rotors can be trickier because whether or not needs replacing depends on its thickness, however if during the test drive you notice vibration when braking, it's likely due to the brake rotors. If the owner hasn't replaced the brakes recently there might be a good opportunity for negotiating the price.\n\n* If the car is a manual ask if the clutch has been replaced. This is a wear item and the time to replace it depends on the usage (cars driven in cities with a lot of stop and go traffic will need a replacement more frequently than cars driving long distances on the freeway).\n\n* For automatics ask when was the last time the transmission fluid was changed. Typically this needs to be replaced every 50-60k miles. Again many service manuals mention that the transmission fluid does not need to be replaced at all, but that's arguably again due to marketing reasons.\n\n* Examine the tires and note how much tread is on the tires. If you were to imagine putting a penny into the tire's tread, a new tire would take up 1/3 - 1/2 of the penny. Also tires need to be replaced every 5 years. The tire sidewall has a 4 digit number which shows the week and year it was manufactured, so it's easy to check if it's due for a replacement. Lastly check if the tires (especially the front) are worn evenly. If the interior part is more worn compared to the exterior, they might indicate suspension or alignment issues. So these issues will need to be addressed and the tires will need to be replaced to fix that problem.\n\n* Ask for and look for any interior problems, bulbs, gauges, AC, power windows not working, stuff like that.\n\n* Check for rust in the wheel wells and rocker panels. Stand back from the car and look for any slight differences in color between it's exterior panels that may indicate they were replaced, also look for dents. The best and easiest indication that a car was repaired or in an accident is if the gaps between body panels is uneven. A good way to identify body panel issues is by running your finger across a body panel, if you feel that one part of the body is lower than the other or if that gap is not consistent, this might mean that the car has been in an accident.\n\n* Look for any signs of fluids, greasy stains on metal, anything that would indicate that it's leaked something. Oil leaks would look dark and greasy. Battery leaks look white and powdery. Coolant leaks look dark and smell sweet. Look at the bottom of the hood, if there are any leak stains there too. Also looks underneath the engine for any greasy spots, because fluids always drip down.\n\n* Do some parts on the car look newer/cleaner than others? A new radiator could mean that the car was recently in a frontal collision.\n\n* Listen to the engine. Does it sound like it's keeping a constant RPM? You may hear some ticking caused by piston slapping or poorly lubricated valves. These are signs that the engine is old, but isn't that big of a deal. Grinding noises are very bad and expensive to fix. Older engines can be pretty noisy until they warm up which is normal.\n\n* Ask the owner to rev the engine while you look at it. Does the engine hop violently when it's revved? This might mean that the engine mounts might need to be replaced.\n\n* Again, ask the owner to rev the engine, this time look at the exhaust. If any blue smoke comes out, or (if it's a warm day outside) any dense white smoke comes out it may indicate that the engine is burning oil, and unless you like adding oil to your engine as often as you fill up your gas tank, it'll be expensive to fix.\n\nTime to take it for a test drive!\n\n* Look at the gauge cluster, is the check engine light on? Keep an eye on the temperature gauge during your trip, does it fluctuate at all? A good car's temperature stays constant during it's trip.\n\n* Take some sharp turns at speed and listen to any thumping or squeeking noises that may come from the suspension or drive train.\n\n* Does the steering wheel shake at all? (when driving it could mean bad alignment or bad steering, when braking it could mean warped rotors)\n\n* Make sure you take the car in and out of all it's gears.\n\n* Listen for funny noises, rattles, squeeks, clanks, vibrations, etc. It's inevitable that older cars will have some interior panels rattle.\n\n* Accelerate hard and brake hard. If the car has ABS does it activate or do you feel that the wheels stop moving?\n\n* Go over some speed bumps, or go on a bumpy road. The car shouldn't be bouncy when recovering from a bump, and neither should it feel like riding over a bump in a shopping cart. It should absorb the bump in a firm but smooth manner.\n\n* After driving for a while, pull over to the side of the road and turn off the car. Pop the hood and look at the coolant resevoir (DON'T OPEN IT!!!) and check if the fluid inside is bubbling or boiling. If it is then the headgasket is blown.\n\n* Remember when we asked the owner when they changed their oil? New oil should look like honey, old oil should have the same color as dark coffee (dark coffee color is a good thing). If the oil is brown or any other funky colors or smells funny something might be wrong with the engine.\n\n* Once you let the car rest for a few minutes check the oil level by using the dipstick if it's not all the way to full, it might be burning or leaking oil.",
        "predicted_response": "\n\nWhen searching for a used car, here are some things to think about and do:\n\n1. Do a search. Make a list of cars you are considering and look them up on reputable websites, or look for any news stories about recalls or safety issues with these models.\n2. Contact local dealers. Find dealerships near you and find cars they have for sale that match your list. They may have a selection to see in person or they may need to have it brought up to your location.\n3.
