According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T.

The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North.

They are not stored in the body for long periods of time and any excess amounts are excreted in the urine, which means that a regular intake is needed to maintain optimal levels. \n\nWater-soluble vitamins include:\n\nVitamin C: an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage and supports immune function. It also plays a role in collagen synthesis and helps the body absorb iron from plant-based foods.\n\nVitamins B: There are eight B vitamins, including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). B vitamins play a crucial role in energy metabolism, as well as the production of red blood cells, brain function, and the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and eyesight.\n\nFat-soluble vitamins:\n\nsoluble in fat and are absorbed with dietary fat in the small intestine. These vitamins are stored in the liver and fatty tissue for long periods of time, and excess amounts can accumulate and potentially cause toxicity. The fat-soluble vitamins include:\n\nVitamin A: essential for vision, skin health, and immune function. It is also important for the growth and development of bones and teeth.\n\nVitamin D: important for bone health as it helps the body absorb calcium. It also plays a role in immune function and may have other health benefits such as reducing the risk of certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nVitamin E: an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage and supports immune function. It may also have a role in reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\nVitamin K: important for blood clotting and bone health. It also plays a role in regulating calcium levels in the body.\n\nFood that comes under water-soluble vitamins:\n\nVitamin A: found in liver, fish oil, eggs, milk, cheese, and dark leafy greens like spinach and kale.\n\nVitamin D: found in fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna, as well as egg yolks and fortified foods like milk, orange juice, and cereals.\n\nVitamin E: found in nuts and seeds like almonds, sunflower seeds, and hazelnuts, as well as vegetable oils like wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oil.\n\nVitamin K: found in leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens, as well as cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, and vegetable oils like soybean oil and canola oil.\n\nFood that comes under Fat -soluble vitamins:\nVitamin C: found in citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, as well as kiwi, strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli, and spinach.\n\nThiamin (B1): found in whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats, as well as pork, legumes, and nuts.\n\nRiboflavin (B2): found in dairy products like milk and yogurt, as well as eggs, meat, leafy greens, and whole grains.\n\nNiacin (B3): found in meat, poultry, fish, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nPantothenic acid (B5): found in meat, poultry, fish, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nPyridoxine (B6): found in meat, poultry, fish, bananas, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nBiotin (B7): found in egg yolks, liver, nuts, and seeds.\n\nFolate (B9): found in leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and fortified grains and cereals.\n\nCobalamin (B12): found in animal products like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy.",

Early structural biologists throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries were primarily only able to study structures to the limit of the naked eye's visual acuity and through magnifying glasses and light microscopes.\n\nIn the 20th century, a variety of experimental techniques were developed to examine the 3D structures of biological molecules. The most prominent techniques are X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy. Through the discovery of X-rays and its applications to protein crystals, structural biology was revolutionized, as now scientists could obtain the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules in atomic detail. Likewise, NMR spectroscopy allowed information about protein structure and dynamics to be obtained. Finally, in the 21st century, electron microscopy also saw a drastic revolution with the development of more coherent electron sources, aberration correction for electron microscopes, and reconstruction software that enabled the successful implementation of high resolution cryo-electron microscopy, thereby permitting the study of individual proteins and molecular complexes in three-dimensions at angstrom resolution.\n\nWith the development of these three techniques, the field of structural biology expanded and also became a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules (especially proteins, made up of amino acids, RNA or DNA, made up of nucleotides, and membranes, made up of lipids), how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function.
