When you are stretching, you are elongating the muscles. If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon\u2019s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Some studies find that people achieve most of their goals in January and then fall off track, while others find that about half of the resolutions are kept for two weeks but many other resolutions are sustained over six months to a year and more. A 2019 survey conducted by the Gail Martin Research Group, an employee engagement and management consulting firm, found that only 16% of the 2018-2019 New Year's resolutions were still in effect a year later.<|eot_id|>",
        "response": "To answer the question, let us look at some statistics from public surveys about new year's resolutions. In 2022 about 46% of all people who made resolutions achieved their goals by the end of the year, 11% kept their resolutions for at least 6 months, 14% lasted at least 3 months, 19% lasted for a month, and 11% quit within a month. To make resolutions more effective, not only make the statement of what you want to change, but also list the steps you take to achieve it, and when you want to achieve it. Here are a few tips: Mentally prepare for change; Set goals that resonate with you; Limit resolutions to a manageable amount; Make resolutions specific, measurable, and time-sensitive; Break big goals up into smaller chunks; Write resolutions down; Automate things to keep tabs on yourself; Remember you can always get back on even if you fall off the track!"
