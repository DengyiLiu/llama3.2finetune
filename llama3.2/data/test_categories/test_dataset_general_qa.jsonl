You would want to make sure that you are not imposing on your neighbors yard, so it is always smart to get a survey done by the local government as well. When you are ready to start installing your fence, you would Dig holes using a post digger at intervals between 3 to 5 feet wide. He would then pour concrete into the holes and put the fence posts in the holes. After the posts are installed, and the concrete is dried, you would nail the wooden planks between the posts to make your fence. When you’re all done, it’s always nice to enjoy a cold beer if you are above the legal limit.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"How do I get better at the game of golf?","context":"","response":"Golf is a game that originated in the 15th century, and to this day, is still being iterated on.  Although there have been many different swing styles over the years, there are fundamentals to playing the game that when followed, have produced the most successful golfers. \n\nBuilding a strong golf foundation using 4 key principles is key to improving at the game of golf which are: aligning your expectations to reality, applying an effective on course strategy, practicing correctly, and, building a sharp mental game.\n\nBy aligning your expectations to the reality of how you are playing, you allow your mind to accept the good with the bad which allows for a more free and easy playing style, often leading to better play.\n\nApplying an effective course strategy will allow you to score better as you know where you can make up strokes on your competitors.  For example, driving distance off the tee paired with greens in regulation play a crucial role in scoring, as opposed to putting whereas you have a 20 foot putt compared to a 40 foot putt, your make percentages are both low.\n\nLearning how to practice correctly can also improve your on course scoring as most approach practice incorrectly.  Zombie range sessions have become the norm, but rarely in golf do you have the same shot twice in a row.  Implement that same theory on the driving range so you have more of a feel of what on course play will feel like.\n\nFinally, in order to improve your scoring, you need to build a sharp mental game while you play.  This includes visualizing your shot before you hit it, being able to clear your head of all unwanted thoughts other than the shot you want to hit, and implementing a pre shot routine that is easily replicable.\n\nBy applying these core 4 strategies, you should see your golf scores decrease without any significant change in your actual swing.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Why is Alien the greatest space horror film of all time?","context":"","response":"For one thing, it does a fantastic job of making the crew of the Nostromo relatable and human. We spend a lot of time with them before any seriously suspenseful or horrific things happen. We understand they're a tight crew, and care about each other, and that they already feel some animosity towards the mining company that sent them out into space. This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.\n\nSecondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.\n\nAnd finally, Alien just feels more \"real\" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all. Its visceral, brutal, claustrophobic terror felt imminently possibly in the 1970s when it was made, and has only increased with time.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"What is the philosophy of the movie Up?","context":"","response":"Ellie is clearly a lot more adventurous than Carl. In fact that is clear in the first few minutes. To Carl, \"Spirit of Adventure\" is a balloon and for her its an abandoned house. The size, I think, matters because that is the size of the spirit of adventure.\n\nAnother thing alluding to her spirit of adventure is the loss of the baby and her subsequent rebounding from the sadness. She takes this grave loss as an adventure in her book. Carl is a good husband to point out that she needs to fulfill her \"Things I am going to do\" promise to herself, but does not realize how Ellie views the loss of the baby.\n\nCarl is stuck on the aspect of having the house on Paradise island. He thinks that Ellie never lived her adventures and never added to her book since her first wish never got fulfilled. \n\nWhen an adventure presents itself in the form of Kevin, Carl, still attached to the past, prefers to fulfill the perceived wish by Ellie. When he does get the home on the water fall, it is clear that he is not satisfied. He can say that the dog nor Kevin are his problems. But when he sits down in his beloved chair, and looks through Ellie book of adventure again, he realizes that Ellie lived her adventures. She had no regrets. Her life was an adventure. And just at the right time, Carl sees the message from her to live his own adventure, i.e. Kevin.\n\nThings become clearer for Carl. He is absolved of his guilt. He realizes that Ellie never felt bad about not being able to have her home on Paradise island. This moment of clarity is what all humans crave for. With this clarity, it was easy for him to be rid of all his attachments. He left behind his and his wife's chairs that he is clearly very attached to.\n\nThe message here, at least for the adults to discern and then communicate to the kids is to live your life. Yes you have dreams. But in day to day life, those dreams may not be achieved. Look for adventure. Look to live fully and without attachment to your dreams like Ellie did. Because, then, in living this full life, it just might be that your dream comes true. It just might be that the house is on Paradise island even without you trying like in the end of the movie!","category":"general_qa"}

Both individual and team metrics are considered when determining the best quarterback. Key individual metrics include individual passing metrics (such as passer rating, number of passing yards, and number of touchdowns thrown) and individual awards won (such as the Heisman trophy). Key team metrics include the team's win percentage with the individual as the starting quarterback and the number of conference and nation championships won. A quarterback that excels at passing the football and running the football is commonly referred to as a \"dual threat\" quarterback. Individual rushing statistics may also be considered when determining their rankings.

{"instruction":"Will robots ever feel and think like humans? Will these robots solve all of our problems, or will they spell the end of the human race?","context":"","response":"Imagine a world where hundreds of robots are working with humans. Some of them deliver food, and some might be working at a cafe or a restaurant. They are all around us, helping people to do many things. Sometimes, they can do what humans can’t do, and they can also sometimes perform better than humans. Nowadays, many scientists and engineers are arguing if artificial intelligence could dramatically make our lives better, or would it spell the end of the human race?\n    Robots and Artificial Intelligence(A.I. for short) are developing systematically but dramatically, so someday, they might feel and think like humans. For example, some robots can “feel” pain by detecting how strong the force is to technically “feel” the pain. Furthermore, robots can think like humans by programming them to think how humans do. However, robots have less flexible thinking, since they are only doing what others programmed them to do, especially robots like Industrial robots that are less complex.\n    However, because A.I. is developing at a great speed, it might eventually become a threat to the human race. Many people such as Steven Hawkings warned that as A.I. develops further, they might be unstoppable, and might become one of the most dangerous enemies. Furthermore, according to the UN, A.I. might have stereotypical thoughts about certain races because of people’s discriminative behavior, and it can further have an impact on judgment between many kinds of people. Primarily, robots and A.I. can be a threat to the human race, so we need to take care of its program and rule it better so that it can be a good tool that can improve our lives.\n    On the other hand, I think that although now, A.I. still has some difficulties in doing certain things, A.I. can solve some of our problems, and make our lives better, and easier. A.I. can solve many problems, and they can even do some work better than humans. For example, robots can go to dangerous places like space, deep sea, and poisonous areas. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous jobs like welding which is dangerous work that needs to be done precisely. Robots are used in places like this because Industrial robots can do work precisely, and they can even save the worker’s life. For another example, a remote robot called Canadarm2 that works in the International Space Station can help astronauts by doing work in space to help the other astronauts that make their life easier.\n    In conclusion, A.I. is starting to become part of our lives since it’s starting to think and feel like humans with a great speed, and although it might become a threat to human races, I still think A.I. can solve many problems by doing what we have trouble doing. Once, Nick Boston claimed that “Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to invent” which means that humans only need to make A.I. because it can do things that other materials can, and it can also create and build itself. Since robots and A.I. can do many things that can help people, A.I. starting to become our reliable assistants as long as we take care of them.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Is it better to visit Yosemite or Venice?","context":"","response":"Yosemite and Venice are both wonderful to visit. Yosemite is best in spring, before the park becomes crowded with summer hordes, and while the waterfalls are in full volume. Venice is best to visit in the Fall, while it's still warm but after the summer hordes have left. The choice between the two depends in part on the season, but also on whether or not you prefer to be in a park in a beautiful natural setting in the case of Yosemite, or in a fascinating and beautiful old world style city in a unique environment with canals, lagoons, boats and museums in the case of Venice. In both places, it's best to be walking to see the sights. In Yosemite you can hike or bike. In Venice you can walk or take a boat ride on the canals. If possible, one should visit both. If one can only visit one of the two, the choice ultimately boils down to one between natural beauty (Yosemite) and old world culture-based beauty (Venice).","category":"general_qa"}

Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"","context":"","response":"A master sculptor in Odisha is hired by the King & Queen to build statutes of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra, on the condition that no one will disturb the master sculptor from his work, until he himself announces that his work is complete.","category":"general_qa"}

If it is met, we will take revenue. If it is not met, revenue contract does not exist, so there is no revenue. Over the contract term, there is no need to reassess the collectability for revenue recognition unless a significant change in facts and circumstances results in a significant deterioration in the customer’s creditworthiness. But we will not reverse revenue previously recognized. Accounts Receivable team can book bad debt allowance reserve and write off for non-payment. If the reassessment concludes that collectability criterion is not met, we need to stop future revenue. If the collectability criterion is still met, we will continue to take revenue, and Accounts Receivable can book bad debt allowance. If we conclude that a contract does not exist because the collectability criterion is not met, we don’t record a receivable for consideration that we have not yet received for the services we have already transferred to the customer. For the cash received, we recognize a deposit liability and record no related revenue.

{"instruction":"Why did my portable solar panel not work when I plugged it into the solar receptor on the side of my camper van?","context":"","response":"Solar is a lot more complicated than just a panel and a battery. Even if you have a system that is pre-wired for solar panels, there is no guarantee it will work right away. This can lead to much frustration and the need to learn more about electrical systems than one may wish. First, a solar controller is needed for all solar-powered systems. Solar controllers regulate the incoming energy, and limit the amount of watts a system can support. Many solar panels come with a solar controller built in, but if you have a system pre-wired with existing solar panels that you are trying to add to there is likely already a solar controller. Adding an additional controller will prevent the new panel from working. If one does not know about solar controllers it can be very difficult to figure out, and may lead to angry overnight Amazon shipments of multimeters to determine what is breaking. However, multiple solar controllers is not the only potential problem. Different solar panel manufacturers have different cord types and connector types, and even within a type of connector there is the idea of “polarity” - the direction a connector needs to be plugged in. This can also lead to internet research, frustration, and more overnight Amazon orders of polarity switching adaptors. If one is especially unlucky it will rain all day once all parts finally arrive, delaying testing of the system.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"How is the game \"ultimate frisbee\" different from \"frisbee golf\"?","context":"","response":"These two games are both played with a frisbee (or \"disc\"), which is a plastic disc that people throw through the air like a ball. The difference is that ultimate frisbee is a team sport that combines several of the rules of football, basketball and soccer. Like football, a team takes possession of the frisbee and tries to move it down field and into an end zone. Like basketball, once you are in possession of the frisbee, you cannot move your pivot foot. However, there is no \"dribbling\" with a frisbee so if a player has possession of the frisbee outside of their end zone, they have to pass it before they can move their pivot foot. Ultimate frisbee is played on a soccer field and the player movement looks most like that sport. Frisbee golf, on the other hand, follows the rules of golf, except that the player throws a frisbee to the hole instead of hitting a ball with clubs. Some people play the sport on dedicated frisbee golf courses, using a set of specialized discs of various weights and carrying them in a bag from hole to hole like a golfer would do with their set of clubs. Others simply take a standard 175-gram frisbee and make up a course as they go. For example, two players might point to a tree on the other side of a park and compete by seeing who can hit the tree with a frisbee in the fewest consecutive attempts.","category":"general_qa"}

You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion. It also causes humans to fall back on visual senses more and ignore other senses which might be counter acting what you see.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Why can helicopters not fly as fast as airplanes?","context":"","response":"In order to fly, aircraft need to produce lift. In airplanes, lift is generated by the air that's flowing over the wings. The faster the airplane flies, the more lift is generated. In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get.

{"instruction":"What kind of cars are good for families with 3 small children?","context":"","response":"When shopping for a car that will accommodate three small children, you need to think about car seats and storage space. Each kid needs to have their own properly installed car seat and you’ll likely need to have enough room for strollers, diaper bags, and other gear. Some mid-size sedans and small SUVs can fit 3 car seats across the back row, but to fit them safely, you’ll need to find the right set of thin car seats the meet the size requirements of your children (e.g. height and weight). For example, Clek makes narrow car seats. That said, taking a trip with 3 kids in these mid-size cars will be challenging unless you add a luggage rack to the top of your car. \n\nMid-size SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, and the Toyota Highlander can accommodate wider car seats in their second row and even include a third row. That said, the third row is difficult to access when car seats are installed in the second row and there isn’t much luggage space when the third row is used for seating.\n\nAll that considered, your best bet for 3 kids and lots of gear is a minivan or full size SUV (Chevy Suburban, GMC Yukon XL, Toyota Sequoia). Choosing between those is a matter of preference. It’s best to test drive the various options at local car dealerships.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Can you please describe the game of golf?","context":"","response":"Golf originated in Scotland in the 15th century. It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"If I'm strong in the gym will I be good at rock climbing?","context":"","response":"The answer is a bit complicated. Being physically fit will benefit you in rock climbing, like it will in many other sports. Traits such as shoulder strength, core strength, and pulling strength are all required to be a successful rock climber.\n\nThe key element needed to become a great or even just good rock climber, however, is finger and wrist strength. So much of rock climbing revolves around your ability to hold on to very tiny or oddly shaped grips to keep you on the wall. Few other sports emphasize finger strength the way rock climbing does. Yet, like all other muscles in your body, finger strength is an element that can be developed over time.\n\nWith the right balance of both general athletics, body control, and finger strength you can become a great rock climber.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is the best kind of shade tree for a backyard in growing region 6?","context":"","response":"There are many great trees homeowners in growing region 6 may want to consider for their backyard depending on their priorities. \n\nFirst, the two main types of trees are deciduous, trees that lose their leaves each winter, and evergreen, which retain their foliage year round. Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions. Enlisting a professional's help with planting will ensure your new tree is set up to grow healthy and strong.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"What are the main disadvantages of electric cars versus combustion engine vehicles?","context":"","response":"Over the past few years, electric vehicles have gained traction amongst the public for different reasons. There are though, some challenges, that can reduce the speed of adoption. The following are some of the concerns associated with electric vehicles:\n    \n1. Higher upfront cost: Electric cars are generally more expensive to acquire than gasoline-powered cars, although this gap is narrowing. But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5. Reduced number of options: Given the relatively new interest from car manufacturers, fewer alternatives are available for individual use cases. It should still take a few years before the offering is similar.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Which MLB baseball team has the most World Series wins?","context":"","response":"The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.\n\nThe best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.\n\nA total of 118 World Series have been contested through 2022, with the AL champion winning 67 and the NL champion winning 51. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 40 World Series, winning 27 – the most championship appearances and most victories by any team amongst the major North American professional sports leagues.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to grow muscle after an age of 35?","context":"","response":"As we age, our bodies undergo various changes. One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age. The key is to focus on compound exercises, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, and make sure you're getting enough protein. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to hit the gym and start building the body you want!","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"What are the advantages of a progressive consumption tax?","context":"","response":"A progressive consumption tax would be a good substitute for a progressive income tax because it would produce greater economic efficiencies by promoting investment and savings while eliminating the income tax's disincentivizing of work. Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%. Most economists agree that a consumption tax would promote economic growth.","category":"general_qa"}

These economists may also be concerned with antitrust policy and its impact on market structure.\n- Macroeconomists study historical trends in the whole economy and forecast future trends in areas such as unemployment, inflation, economic growth, productivity, and investment. \nFinancial Economists study the money and banking system and the effects of rising interest rates. \n- Public Finance Economists primarily are involved in studying the role of the government in the economy and the effects of tax cuts, budget deficits, and welfare policies.\nInternational Economists study international financial markets, exchange rates, and the effects of various trade policies such as tariffs.\n- Labor Economists study the supply and demand for labor and the determination of wages. These economists also try to explain the reasons for unemployment, and the effects on labor markets of changing demographic trends such as an aging population and increasing immigration. \n- Econometricians are involved in all areas of economics and use mathematical techniques such as calculus, game theory, and regression analysis to formulate economic models. These models help to explain economic relationships and are used to develop forecasts related to the nature and length of business cycles, the effects of a specific rate of inflation on the economy, the effects of tax legislation on unemployment levels, and other economic phenomena. Many economists have applied these fundamental areas of economics to more narrow areas with specific applications such as health, education, agriculture, urban and regional economics, law, history, energy, and the environment. \n\nEconomists may work in Business, Finance Government and Academia.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What are crawfish and how do you eat them?","context":"","response":"Crawfish are considered a staple of cajun cuisine.  Many Louisiana natives and surrounding southern states eat these crustaceans.  To eat crawfish, sometimes called crawdads or mudbugs, you first need to purchase them.  Crawfish are usually sold by the sack with typical weights around 30-40 pounds.  You must then clean the crawfish as their natural habitats are within mud, swamps, and muck.   Rinsing them thoroughly in water is required.  Many will do this a sack at a time and continue to rinse until the water is crystal clear noting that they're clean.  Others go a step further through a process of purging.  This is using salt to have the crawfish clean out its insides.  Many think purging is a myth and simply skip this step.  Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.  Learning to peel a crawfish is an art, but can be quickly done by twisting off the tail.  Peel the rest of the shell off and eat the tail.  Many will also suck the head to get a burst of flavor.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"When I ski my legs form an A-frame shape and it doesn't look very nice, how can I fix this?","context":"","response":"A-frame can occur due to many reasons, this includes improper boot setup, for example, the cuff alignment is incorrect, or technique issues. It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg.","category":"general_qa"}

Groups form to represent constituencies, where leaders are elected and engage in compromise decision-making within their group and with leaders of other groups. Groups with opposing interests prevent the accumulation of power with one group.\nCritics of this theory argue that Dahl only talked about policy decisions that were openly debated.  There is a private or hidden power struggle where it is decided whether or not to consider policy at all. Second, that there are cumulative inequalities where those with a low level of resources are not able to mobilize and represent their own interests. Lastly, a group's leadership does not always represent the rank and file membership of the group as a whole.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is a good approach to grocery shopping?","context":"","response":"Grocery shopping can be a difficult task because grocery stores are often crowded.  A good approach to grocery shopping is to go during hours when not a lot of people are grocery shopping.  An example would be during a lunch break instead of going at night when most people are off of work or going during the work week instead of going on the weekend.  Avoid Sundays at all costs!  Sundays are the busiest day for grocery shopping.  Once you've selected your day and before you've gone to the store, make a list.  A list will make you more efficient once you get to the grocery store.  Organize your list by aisles.  An example of this is organizing your list by produce, meats, household supplies, snacks, and drinks.  This way you can go aisle-to-aisle skipping aisles that don't have what you are shopping for.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"When is the best time to transplant bearded iris?","context":"","response":"Bearded iris are one of the most popular perennial flowers in the American landscape.  They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"How is data engineering different from data science?","context":"","response":"Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.\nData Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle. Once the data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. \nIn essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:\nRaw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Write a review of Neil Gaiman's book American Gods.","context":"","response":"What a phenomenal book. I can see how people would call this a \"more mature Percy Jackson\", but to me American Gods was much more than just mythology fanfiction. Overall, the imaginative story, noir setting, mysterious plot, witty dialogue, and incredible characters made this one of the best books I've read this year.\n\nStarting with the setting and premise - gods in the modern world has become a setting of it's own. Most notably, this story reminds me of a western version of Noragami, where a god's strength stems from their worshipers. It's hilarious to see deities of old living mundane lives, frankly quite charming. Our characters navigate through a spooky setting, but it's never overbearing nor depressing.\n\nBut what really makes this book special are the characters and dialogue. Shadow and Wednesday are an amazing duo; between Shadows quiet reflections and Wednesday's blunt terrorizing, the pair travel across rural America, running through a plethora of interesting icons and people.","category":"general_qa"}

If you live in a warm climate year-round, a convertible is a great choice for enjoying the weather while you drive. If you live in a location with more traditional seasons, consider a convertible that has a hard-top rather than a soft-top. This will be more robust against rain and snow, although these vehicles tend to be a little more expensive. Also consider how you plan to use the car: if you find yourself stuck in traffic most of the time during a commute, for example, you may not enjoy owning a convertible as much because you may feel hot and the pollution may bother your lungs.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is a classified board of directors, and why would a company want to implement this type of corporate structure?","context":"","response":"For companies that are incorporated in Delaware, the Delaware General Corporation Law permits corporations to divide their boards of directors into up to 3 classes.  Other states in the United States have similar provisions regarding classified boards.\n\nFor boards that have only 1 class, each director serves a fixed term (generally 1 year), and each director is subject to re-election each year.  \n\nClassified boards (also known as staggered boards) are divided into three separate classes (in equal proportion, to the extent possible), with members of each class serving three-year terms and only one class of directors up for election in any year.  \n\nA classified board is one type of protection that companies consider as part of a wider range review of corporate defensive measures.  Generally, corporate defensive measures relate to measures for a company to consider to protect against (1) hostile takeovers that the board believes do not reflect the value of the company and (2) short-termism, where there is pressure from public investors – particularly activist investors – to take board actions (or face the risk of being voted off the board) that the board believes are not in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and maximizing value over the long term.  Corporate defensive measures generally aren’t relevant when a company is private given the corporate structure with significant long-term investor representation on the board and various agreements in place with stockholders.  However, these measures become relevant once a company has public stockholders, so many companies who are considering an initial public offering will assess what types of defensive measures would be appropriate for them.\n\nA classified board is viewed as corporate defensive measure (i.e., it’s an anti-takeover and activist defense) as the entire board can’t be replaced in a single election cycle (with 3 classes, it would take up to the 3rd election cycle for the full board to be replaced, and generally 2 years to capture a majority).","category":"general_qa"}

Bligh used his memory of navigation charts to plan a course westward to the Dutch colony of Timor.  \n\nThey initially tried stopping at an island to gather supplies.  The island was inhabited, however, and they were attacked.  One crew member was killed and the rest barely escaped.  From then on they dared not stop at any island until reaching the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (then called New Holland by the Europeans).\n\nIn a remarkable achievement of seamanship, Bligh and his men sailed and rowed their open boat for 41 days over a distance of 3618 miles, in sometimes harsh weather conditions.  Food and drink had to be strictly rationed, and the men suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.  Except for the death of the crewman at the hands of the islanders, all the remaining crew reached Timor alive.  Sadly, some men died of disease contracted at the colony town of Batavia or on the final return voyage to Europe.  Of the original nineteen men set adrift by the Bounty mutineers, twelve returned alive to England.\n\nBligh continued his career in the British Navy.  He was assigned a new ship and once again sailed to Tahiti take breadfruit to British colonies in the Caribbean.  This time, the mission was completed successfully.

{"instruction":"When do avalanches occur?","context":"","response":"Avalanches are primarily caused by unstable snow conditions. Although a mountainside covered in snow might appear as a uniform surface, it is actually made up of many layers of snow from different storms, each of which might have very different compositions. For example, a \"dry\" snow from a very cold storm might land directly on top of a sun-baked layer which turned to ice. The point at which these layers meet is called an interface, and is where slipping or sliding of one layer on top of another is most likely to occur. This occurrence is what can trigger an avalanche. Snow conditions on a slope can also evolve over time with wind and sun and other weather patterns, so even a once-safe slope might increase in risk under certain conditions. People recreating in the outdoors in the winter can benefit from learning about these situations from avalanche professionals.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"Given the current banking crisis we are experiencing, is this a redux of the 2008 crisis?","context":"","response":"While there are some similarities between 2023 and 2008, I do not believe this is a similar crisis.  The biggest difference is that in 2008, nearly every bank had widespread exposure to mortgage backed securities.  In the 2023 crisis, it is only a few banks that had overexposure to treasuries without any hedge against rising interest rates.   Additionally, in 2008, while two different banks collapsed, there was much more widespread fear amongst the banks that caused a credit crunch.  Banks were unwilling to lend each other money for fear of liquidity problems, which in turned led to the credit markets freezing and causing secondary problems of companies being unable to attain lines of credit to meet payroll.   In 2023, there was also a failure of 2 banks, but the failure stemmed from a traditional bank run where depositors, en mass, were attempting to withdraw their funds at the same time, causing a liquidity problem with the affected banks.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is a good way to start a garden bed in my backyard?","context":"","response":"Double digging your garden bed can yield great results. Take a shovel and dig one blade length into the soil and set that to the side. Then dig out a second blade length into the soil and set this portion to the side as well. Put the first portion back into the hole you've dug and then place the second portion on the top. By following this method, you can exchange the subsoil and topsoil. Alternatively, you can build a raised garden bed using wood or other material you have hand like corrugated metal. A raised garden bed should have sides that are about 1 - 3 feet high although you can vary this based on your needs. Fill the garden bed with soil mix from your local garden store or from other areas of your yard. Once the garden bed is filled, you can begin planting. Finally, you can use a sheet mulching method to start a garden bed in your backyard. Take thick cardboard or several sheets of a heavy paper material and lay it down on top of a grassy area in your backyard. You want to make sure that the cardboard or paper is overlapped so that it blocks all light to soil and grass underneath it. Once you have finished laying down your material to block the light, spread compost on top so it is three to six inches deep. You can plant into this compost layer. As a final layer, place one to three inches of mulch or straw on top to protect your compost layer.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is the sport called Cricket","context":"","response":"Cricket is a sport first originated in Wngland. Cricket was invented by British. While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end. Batter can send the ball to the boundary while pitching on the ground one or more times to score 4 runs or hit the ball over the boundary without having it bounce on the ground to score 6 runs. Fielding team will place 11 of their players at various locations in the field. Person from the fielding team throwing the ball to a batter from batting team is called a bowler. Bowler’s goal is to get the batter out. Bowler will typically throw the ball on the pitch letting it bounce once on the pitch and eventually reaching a batter. There are different ways to dismiss or get a batter out. The bowler can throw the ball to a batter, induce a shot from the batter and have that ball caught directly by one of the fielder in the field. Bowler can also throw the ball toward a batter to make him or her miss and to hit the stumps or bails, thus disturbing his wicket. Bowler will deliver ball 6 times when their turn comes up. The grouping of 6 deliveries that a bowler throws to a batter is called an Over. Batters can also get run out while attempting to score a run and getting caught outside of their safe zone marked by a crease at each end of the pitch. Modern game of cricket contains many versions. These versions are called Test Cricket, One day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20. Originally, game of cricket lasted for many days. In the older version of the game , each team got a chance to bat twice and field twice taking as many days as possible to conclude the game. In modern version of the game, this mode of play called Test Cricket has been fixed to five days. So, Test cricket can last as many as five days.  One day internationals (also referred to as ODI) is a game of cricket that lasts one day. Each side gets 50 overs to bowl to another team and each side gets to bat once. Goal of a team is to score as many runs as possible in 50 overs while restricting their opposition to lesser score or getting them out completely. ODI typically lasts for 6 to 7 hours. Even more popular version of the game is called Twenty20 or T20. In this mode of the game, each team only gets 20 overs to bat and have to get their opponents out in 20 overs or to restrict them to lesser number of runs. This mode of cricket is very popular because the game only lasts for 3 hours requiring much less time of the viewers. There are many countries beside England that currently play cricket making the sport a truly global sport. The countries that play cricket are England, South Africa, Australia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies.  The sport is also played by new entrants in the game, namely Netherlands, Ireland, Namibia, UAE, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Papua New Guinea.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is a flat white.","context":"","response":"Originating from either Australia or New Zealand, a flat white is a coffee based drink typically consisting of a double shot of espresso and steamed milk.  A double shot of espresso amounts to 60ml in volume and this is added to with approximately 100ml of milk.  The process of steaming the milk modifies the proteins to create a thick foamy  consistency allowing baristas to create patterns on top of the milk from the brown of the coffee and white of the milk. This is often referred to as latte art.\n\nAlthough similar to a latte, the flat white has a stronger coffee flavour due the having a higher proportion of coffee to milk. The latte typically has a total volume of approximately 240ml compared to the 160ml in a flat white.  In addition, the foamy milk is thicker in a flat white giving it a \"flatter\" appearance.\n\nAlthough originating from the southern hemisphere, flat whites have gained global popularity and are now both a mainstay for specialist coffee shops as well as large  coffee shop chains such as Starbucks.","category":"general_qa"}

It is important to note that an egg does not instantly turn into a chicken and there is a vast and potentially infinite spectrum of transitionary states.

Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions.

{"instruction":"Is voluntary childlessness rising? If yes, then what are the major drivers?

There are numerous reasons why being childfree is trending. The decision to have a child comes with responsibilities and many couples do not want to embrace it. Some couples avoid the idea of having children based on past experience in the family or simply because not having a child opens new avenues to explore and spend time doing other meaningful things in life. Unwillingness to bear the financial burden of raising a child is another reason why some couples avoid the idea.\n\nNevertheless, the trend represents the rise in deterioration of interpersonal relationships. It prevents overpopulation and indirectly impacts events like recession, inflation, global warming etc. and in a consumer centric world the resonance of this trend cannot be ignored in the global economy.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Why are In-N-Out cheeseburgers so good?","context":"","response":"In-N-Out cheeseburgers are seen as good for a few reasons.  The meat is never frozen and tight quality controls at their processing plants insure a consistent and high quality meat patty.  The incentive structure for the In-n-out employee results in workers staying at the fast food chain longer with the manager frequently in charge of employees and the actual cooking of the burger patties.  This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.  Lastly their slow growth and enthusiastic fans provide a positive atmosphere lending itself to people thinking more highly of In-n-out where without this influence might be neutral on the brand.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is \"strokes gained\" in golf?","context":"","response":"Strokes gained is a method of measuring a golfer's performance that revolutionized how people think about golf strategy and how they compare the performance of golfers.  \n\nSimply put, strokes gained measures how many strokes a player gains on every shot they hit in a round of golf.  \n\nFor example, if a player stands on the tee of a par 4 that is 375 yards long, their expected score for the hole for their skill level would be 4.0 strokes.  Assume they hit a strong drive of 275 yards, and land in the fairway.  Now their expected score for the hole might be 3.8.  Since their expected score went from 4.0 to 3.8 as a result of the drive, they gained .2 strokes with the drive.\n\nIf you repeat this for every shot in a round of golf, you would gain a picture of strokes gained for the overall round.\n\nOne key to strokes gained is what an expected score is for each hole.  This was first calculated for tour pro players when shot by shot stats were available via the ShotLink system used in pro events.  With the advent of consumer-level shot tracking systems, it is now possible to generated expected scores for virtually all levels of golfers, and thus any golfer can track strokes gained for their round, as compared to any level of golfer.\n\nStrokes gained is typically further broken down into 4 categories : Off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.\n\nThe insights available once strokes gained was available has allowed insights into what really allows golfer to separate themselves from their competition.  Most notably, strokes gained was able to show that skill in driving is much more of a separator than is putting skill.  This went against many decades of conventional wisdom.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What are some of the challenges and solutions involved in growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest?","context":"","response":"Growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is very possible, but can present a number of challenges. The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Monster Hunter 4 Unlimited (hereafter, \"MH4U\") was a video game released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS circa 2013. Elden Ring was a video game released for multiple platforms in circa 2022 to critical acclaim. \n\nIf MH4U and Elden Ring were considered to be siblings nine years apart in a small family, how might the experiences of MH4U have influenced the growth and development of Elden Ring?","context":"","response":"Young parents face many challenges. Finances, education, and home expenses often compete with the needs of a growing family. Within the context provided, MH4U reflects the first child of a young couple who must make several investments, including clothing, baby essentials, and furniture.  This may be conveyed under the limited system resources available to MH4U under the 3DS console: 128MB of RAM. Additionally, one or both parents may work full time, leaving limited time to work with and grow the child. As the child, MH4U,  enters age 9, they should be entering 4th or 5th grade and have developed the cognitive and functional skills to support their parents. Additionally, the parents will have likely developed further in their careers and caretaking abilities that ensure the stability and growth of a small family. In this example, Elden Ring represents the second child, which arrives nine years after MH4U. In this context, as a result of the growth of experience and income of the family, and assuming the family equates to a Playstation 4, the family now enjoys 8GB of RAM.\n\nAs described in the preceding paragraph, the familial environment that Elden Ring emerges from is vastly different than that of MH4U. However, there are additional benefits beyond the system limitations provided. These benefits are conveyed through the emotional and physical support provided through familial bonds, in this case, that of an older and younger sibling. Upon the arrival of Elden Ring, MH4U is eager to help their parents with caretaking tasks which may include keeping the child company, completing small jobs and errands, and establishing familial bonds with their sibling. The parents will be able to draw upon the experience of raising MH4U and apply those lessons to their newest member of the family. It’s important that the parents continue to create small jobs for MH4U that help to convey positive responses to younger family members: caretaking, guidance, and companionship. \n\nAs MH4U graduates from their teens and enters early adulthood, it’s critical that they stay actively involved in the life of their sibling. By age 18, MH4U will now be nine years older than Elden Ring, which as it happens, is the same age when MH4U became an older sibling. Under this lens, MH4U carries greater social responsibility than they did when they were the same age as Elden Ring. MH4U may also begin to contemplate leaving the family for continuing education. While it’s common for individuals to depart the family for secondary education after age 18, it’s critically important that MH4U continue to maintain constant contact with its younger sibling to provide guidance and advice and convey lessons learned from its formative experiences.  \n\nIn this way, Elden Ring has a fast track to develop. MH4U is able to provide guidance equatable to best practices, experiences, and trial and error. Additionally, MH4U development during constrained resources encourages Elden Ring to do “more with less” and ensures a fastidious approach towards the allocation of resources. By the time Elden Ring approaches age 18, they enjoy the combined experiences of their parents and their older sibling which helps to increase their likelihood of success and families are stronger when they provide guidance and stability to their children.\n\nIn summary, the success of Elden Ring was no accident. The investments of the parents into the older sibling, MH4U, however lacking, provided a baseline level by which MH4U could invest in its younger sibling Elden Ring. Through this chain of investments, the family finds a greater chance of success. Under the lens of the original context, there would not be a critically reception to Elden Ring had not the parents made baseline investment and support to MH4U during the formative years of the family.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between hardwood and softwood?","context":"","response":"These refer to two very large categories of wood species. Softwoods are generally fast-growing trees such as pine and fir commonly found throughout the world. They are most commonly used for construction and large volume projects as they are cheaper to produce and readily available, as the trees themselves do not take as long to grow. Hardwoods, on the other hand, are called \"hard\" because of much denser grains: compared to softwoods, hardwoods weigh more per volume due to this property. In other words, a board of walnut (a hardwood) weighs more than a board of the same size of pine (a softwood). They are more expensive because the trees take longer to grow and are typically more rare, but are used in fine wood-crafting arts like furniture making due to their robustness and beauty in the grain structure.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"How do you play chess?","context":"","response":"Chess is a game that is played on a checkerboard, which is composed of 64 alternating black and white squares that indicate where a player's pieces can be placed. There are six different types of pieces in chess, including: Pawns, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, a Queen, and a King. Each of these pieces can move on the board in different ways. The goal of the game is to utilize your pieces to capture your opponent's king. In a game of chess, players alternate turns moving one piece at a time. When a player moves a piece, they are either positioning the piece on an open square where no other piece is currently on, or they are capturing an opponent's piece. To win a game of chess, players will balance strategically positioning their pieces and capturing their opponent's pieces. Doing so will allow a player to have the opportunity to put their opponent in a position called \"Checkmate\". When a player is checkmated, it means that their King is in an attacking line of one or more of their opponent's pieces and they have no legal moves to escape this attack. If a player is checkmated, they have lost the game.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What would be the pros and cons of replacing all civilian airplanes with dirigibles?","context":"","response":"Replacing all civilian airplanes with dirigibles would have positive and negative effects. The most notable positive effect would be reduced environmental impact: although dirigibles, like airplanes, need engines, dirigibles are filled with lighter-than-air gas and therefore no power is needed to counteract gravity, so they consume less fuel. However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes.","category":"general_qa"}
{"instruction":"What is the appeal to baby led weaning?","context":"","response":"Baby led weaning, or BLW, is the practice of weaning a baby from breast feeding naturally by allowing the child to begin eating solid food freely by their own choice. For example, while the care takers are eating a meal, allowing the child (at any age) to pick food from the care taker's plate. There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Can we move away from fossil fuels in the next decade  ?","context":"","response":"According to the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a consensus statement from over 97% of the world’s climate scientists, burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest contributor to human driven climate change. Fossil fuels are responsible for over 75% of Greenhouse gas emissions and over 97% of carbon dioxide emissions. These reports have also stressed that there’s an immediate need to move away from these fuels in the near future. \n\nThe challenge to this paradigm shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a combination of social and political barriers, the cost for new infrastructure to manage new energy portfolios , fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices and challenges to energy storage. \n\nIn April 2022, McKinsey published their Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective report, where they highlighted a rapid increase in traditional energy ( Oil and Gas) over the next 5 years, however the report also shows a rise in renewable energy and Hydrogen following that 5 year mark. While each adoption of this will differ in each country, the consensus is we will have a mixed energy portfolio (renewables and traditional) for the next 3 decades. The data also suggests as we see technology improve for more sustainable management of assets, batteries and resources, we will see a decline in the extraction , transportation  and consumption of fossil fuels.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"What is the best electrical system for RVs?","context":"","response":"There have been recent improvements in RV electrical systems. At the core, RVs run off “house batteries”, or large batteries that power the RV portion of the vehicle. There are several types of batteries available, and several ways of powering these batteries. The two main types of batteries are lead acid, and lithium. Lithium batteries are newer technology and will not be found in older RVs unless retrofitted. Lithium batteries have a larger charge capacity and can discharge safely further than lead acid batteries. However, lead acid batteries are cheaper. There are several ways of charging these batteries. The most common is a plug that provides either 30A or 50A of power, depending on the RV size. Most RVs also have generators, but generators are noisy and require either gas or diesel to run. Some RVs with lithium batteries (or more rarely, lead acid), have a second alternator installed that charges the batteries while driving. Finally, solar power is a popular option. Solar power is completely quiet and renewable, but can be expensive to install and is slower to charge batteries. Most RVs have a combination of the above, and consumers choose the system that best fits their lifestyle.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"Why are there so many different types of cheeses in France?","context":"","response":"Cheese production has a long history in France. It is believed that cheese was first introduced into France during Roman times. After the fall of the Roman empire, monasteries continued the production of cheese. Experimentation within the monasteries, regional isolation and differences in climate and vegetation across France lead to the creation of regional varieties of cheese (some of which still exist today). From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese – although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties! These cheeses are made from cows, sheep, goats or buffalo milk.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a famous French president, once asked - \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\" It would be interesting to hear what his thoughts would be today now that there are almost 1000 different varieties.","category":"general_qa"}

{"instruction":"How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?","context":"","response":"Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. \n\nWhen you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.\n\nSo, that’s my answer.

{"instruction":"How do you jump start a car?","context":"","response":"1. Make sure both batteries have the same voltage (they probably do unless one car is old). Don’t jump start a frozen battery (it may explode), or a battery with cracks in the casing\nKeep metal objects away from the battery. If they cause a spark it could be dangerous.\n\n2. Park the two cars facing each other, close but with enough space to walk in between.\n\n3. Remove the keys from the ignitions, turn off lights\/blinkers.\n\n4. Disconnect all accessories (voltage spikes can damage them).\n\n5. Clamp one of the red (positive) clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery. If there is corrosion on the terminal, clean off or scrape the residue, and\/or twist the jaws of the clamp until it cuts through the corrosion and into the metal. Make sure the black clamp of the same end isn’t touching any metal.\n\n6. Connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal of the good battery.\n\n7. Connect the black (negative) clamp to the negative terminal of the good battery.\n\n8. Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface (e.g. bolt, bracket) on the engine of the car with the dead battery, at least a few inches away from the battery. If a labeled remote negative terminal is available, use it.\n\n9. Confirm that the jumper cables are not near any moving engine parts.\n\n10. Start the booster car, and let it idle for 5 minutes to build up a charge in the dead battery. This will take longer if the dead battery is really empty.\n\n11. Start the car with the dead battery and let the two vehicles idle for a few minutes. If the car doesn’t start, wait a few more minutes and try again. In some instances, slightly revving the engine of the running car while charging the dead battery may help. If it still doesn’t start, it probably won’t.\n\n12. Disconnect the jumper cables reversing the connection order, making sure no disconnected clamps touch any metal or each other\n\n13. Drive the jump-started car for at least 20-30 minutes so it can recharge the battery\nTry to keep the jumper cables with you; you may need to jump again the next time you start the car.","category":"general_qa"}
