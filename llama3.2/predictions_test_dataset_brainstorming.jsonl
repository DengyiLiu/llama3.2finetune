        "predicted_response": "Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting hit by falling windows detached from tall building by strong winds from cyclones or tornadoes: \n1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.\n2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. \n3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. \n4. You might think that being inside a car would be a safe option, but vehicles are notoriously dangerous places to be in during high winds because of their susceptibility to being blown over or blown away or for their windows to explode.",

This is because every tendon has a stretch reflex, and when triggered, will cause the muscle connected to it to contract; for example, when the patellar tendon underneath your knee is hit by your doctor during your yearly checkup, your quads contract involuntarily and your leg kicks up.

If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon\u2019s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Hot yoga provides higher flexibility and yogis can stretch a bit more than cold rooms. Hot rooms can increase heart rates. However one has to be careful as there is a tendency overstretch  that can cause injuries."

        "predicted_response": "Absolutely no! Daylight Savings originated around WWI in an effort to conserve fuel and electricity. US enacted the act to preserve Daylight saving time in 1918 and established standard time zone across the States. However, with modern power grids and diverse night life, Daylight Savings is seemingly not relevant today. A lot of people complain about the inconvenience in turning the clock back and forth twice a year. The rate of being late for schedules or air flights on the day of daylight saving starts or ends every year is much higher than any other day in a year. In fact, even in the US, Arizona and Hawaii do not recognize daylight saving time. So do a lot of other countries like China and Japan. For European countries, the daylight saving switch date differs from one to another.

        "response": "Absolutely no! Daylight Savings originated around WWI in an effort to conserve fuel and electricity. US enacted the act to preserve Daylight saving time in 1918 and established standard time zone across the States. However, with modern power grids and diverse night life, Daylight Savings is seemingly not relevant today. A lot of people complain about the inconvenience in turning the clock back and forth twice a year. The rate of being late for schedules or air flights on the day of daylight saving starts or ends every year is much higher than any other day in a year.
